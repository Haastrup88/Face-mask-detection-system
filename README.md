# Face-mask-detection-system
The system is designed to detect the faces and to determine whether the person wears a face mask or not. 
Using the above data, we can decide whether the concerned person can be allowed inside public places such as the market, or a hospital. 
This project can be used in the hospital, market, bus terminals, restaurants, and other public gatherings where the monitoring has to be done.
This project consists of a camera that will capture the image of the people entering public places and detect whether the person wears a face mask or not using their facial features.

The FaceMask Detection project was developed at the National Institute of Applied Science and Technology (INSAT) in September 2020.
